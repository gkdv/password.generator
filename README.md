# password.generator

The function of this program is produce a password of many characters and variable 
length to be copied and used anywhere.

The webpage will prompt the user to input the amount of characters they would like 
in the password and select the different characters available. Characters being 
numbers, special, upper and lowercase. 

The program as of this version does have some limitations that have yet to be 
overcome. Those being the combination of different characters is limited due to the 
limitations of the user prompt logic. 

Later version will add more user functionality to the inputs but for now it is 
best practice to include all character options when prompted. 

ENJOY!
